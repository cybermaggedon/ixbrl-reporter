- **layout.py**: 95% coverage (258/270 statements)
- **data_source.py**: 99% coverage (151/153 statements)
- **taxonomy.py**: Comprehensive unit tests implemented

### Integration Tests âœ…
- **End-to-end workflow tests**: Complete workflow from config to output
- **File I/O integration tests**: CSV and GnuCash file handling
- **Report generation tests**: Full report generation with different formats

### Contract Tests âœ…
- **Data format contracts**: YAML validation, CSV format validation
- **iXBRL output contracts**: XML validation, namespace handling
- **Template contracts**: Variable substitution, structure validation

### Regression Tests âœ…
- **15 test configurations**: All legacy tests integrated into pytest
- **Direct library integration**: Using ixbrl-parse Python API
- **Helper tools**: Update script for managing expected outputs
- **Parallel execution support**: Works with pytest-xdist

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=ixbrl_reporter --cov-report=html

# By category
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m contract      # Contract tests only
pytest -m regression    # Regression tests only

# Parallel execution
pytest -n auto
```

### Coverage Summary
- Overall line coverage: ~85%+ for tested modules
- Critical modules (config, accounts, data_source): >95% coverage
- Comprehensive test suite covering all major functionality

## Migration Status

### Phase 1: âœ… Completed
- Pytest infrastructure added alongside legacy tests
- Both systems coexist successfully

### Phase 2: âœ… Completed  
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Contract tests for data formats
- Regression tests integrated with pytest

### Phase 3: ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Legacy shell scripts remain for backwards compatibility
- Can be gradually phased out as team becomes comfortable

## Key Achievements

1. **Modern Test Framework**: Full pytest adoption with fixtures and markers
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: >80% coverage on all tested modules
3. **Regression Safety**: All 15 legacy test configurations preserved
4. **Performance**: Tests run in parallel, complete in <15 seconds
5. **Maintainability**: Clear test organization and documentation

## CI/CD Integration âœ…

### GitHub Actions Workflows
1. **Continuous Integration**: Runs all tests on push to master
2. **Pull Request Testing**: Matrix testing with Python 3.12 and 3.13
3. **Regression Testing**: Weekly scheduled runs and on-demand execution

### Test Execution in CI
- Unit tests with coverage reporting to Codecov
- Integration and contract tests on every push
- Regression tests (fast subset) on every push
- Full regression suite weekly or on demand
- Type checking with mypy

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring test execution times
2. Add performance benchmarks for large files
3. Consider property-based testing for edge cases
4. Implement mutation testing for test quality
5. Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance and optimize as needed

The testing infrastructure is now robust, modern, and provides excellent coverage for continued development.
